	<p class="birth"> Everyone's Life Beging the same wya. A Mother gets pregrnant and 9ish months later pops out a crying baby. </p>
	<p class="kid"> Then comes the phase as a child where everything is simple and innocnet. All we want is something sweet to eat and to spend time with our friends. </p> 
	<p class = "teen"> Then life starts to get complicated. High School hits and all the drama associated with it wheter it be bulling, bad gardes or high school romance. Honestly its not the best time for most people. </p> 
	<p class = "college"> NOW THE FUN TIME OF LIFE... COLLEGE! Where you are free from your parents, sibling and are old enough to do whatever you want. Wheter it be partying, trips, napping all day or actually studying for your degree.</p>
    <p class="wedding"> Everyones desired or dreaded day. Wheter one actually gets married or not everyone desires to find that significant other they intend to spend the rest of their life with...hopefully.</p>
	<p class="adult">Great. Time to be an Adult and do Adult things. Like cooking, cleaning, working, having kids and ect. No time to be spontaneous and do things selfishly anymore. This is the time for the good and bad days with your kids, your personal life, family life and romantic life. This period connsumes like at least 2/3 of your life depending on how long you live. </p>
	<p class="old"> The time everyone looks forward to or dreads. The age of infantles knowledge (human wise) and when one feels they can do whatever they want becuase hey your old. But with most peple comes a time of sadness and regret. Regret of not living life they way one wanted to. Realizing life flashed before our very eyes and there is no time left or anything. NO time to visit that place you  always wanted to go to. NO time to say that thing to the person you always wanted to. No time let people know how you really feel, especially the ones you ove the most. Life is short and will be over before we all know it. Life Is to short, so live everyday like it is the last becuase granted you do live a long and full life you do not want to go wishinng you had more time to do the things you always wanted to.</p>
    <p class="life"> Life's too short, so live everyday like it's your last. Regret nothing and do everything you ever dreamed of achieving.</p>

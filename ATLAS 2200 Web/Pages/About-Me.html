<p lang="en" class="p-about-me"> 
                 My name is Lianne Gill but I just go by my last name Gill (like the part of the fish). I am a very dedicate driven person who just desires the knowledge and capability to create fun, cool and positively life changing technology. I am currently a Sophmore  at the University of Colorado Boulder and am double mjoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) along with Technology Arts and Media (TAM). Interestly enough, my inspiration for my majors was becuase of Ironman (the movie) and J.A.R.V.I.S. Someday I desire to create something like if not better than J.A.R.V.I.S! During my off hours, I enjoy being lazy and sleeping...A LOT! I would say my spirit animal is a sloth. I am in Love with nutella and partake in various sports to stay active.

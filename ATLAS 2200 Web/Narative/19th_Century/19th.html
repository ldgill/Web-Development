         First of all, you ain’t got no light. So, don't trip chocolate chip.  On the plus, you are probably in the best shape of your life physically or the worse mentally because the elevator break, yes the elevator break does not exist. So you only options are stairs (gross <a href="../21st_Century/21st.html">exercise</a>) or the brakeless elevator (mmmmm how ready am I to die today…?).  But whether you are in shape or not does not really matter considering there are no jean for you to try and fit into. That’s not even the worse part…there’s no <a href="../16th_Century/16th.html">MUSIC</a>! Well there is music, probably, but solely live. Thus there is no bumping the jams on a record player or the radio with the homies and just jamming out, but I guess having to get out and see live performances adds to your improvement of health. So congrats you get to <a href="../Middle_Ages/MA.html">live</a> longer during these trying times.

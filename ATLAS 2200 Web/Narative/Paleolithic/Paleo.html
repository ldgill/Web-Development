        It is <a href="../16th_Century/16th.html">cold</a>, <a href="../19th_Century/19th.html">dark</a> and you need some <a href="../18th_Century/18th.html">food</a>. Sadly, you have nothing to see with or keep you warm assuming fire was not invented.  So what now? Hopefully your eyes have adjusted and you find some nice warm leaves in a not damp cave to live in otherwise it seems you a screwed! What about food you ask? It will be cold and raw. Unfortunately, you cannot use stones and plants to create weapons because that is technology! Want my advice? You better let them fingernails grow out for some prime claws because this is the beginning of time minus technology so all that exist is your naked body and the dangerous nature.

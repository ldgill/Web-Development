          Ah man! I am late to my meeting with <a href="../18th_Century/18th.html">Da Vinci</a> again. Probably because that one guy with the face still has not invented the watch. Guess I will have to write him a letter to apologize once again.

I will oin you before late afternoon so do not feel the need to wait for me.  As a heads, I do not mean to be a erk but I will not be able to come in on time so you should ust make it a habit to start work without.

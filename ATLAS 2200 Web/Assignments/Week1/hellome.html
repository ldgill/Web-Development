    <h1>Hello Me</h1> 
    <p lang="en"> I am a very dedicate driven person who just desires the knowledge and capability to create fun, cool and positively life changing technology. Interestly enough, my inspeation for becoming a electrical and computer engineer was becuase I watch Ironman and absolutely love J.A.R.V.I.S. Someday I want to make something like if not better than J.A.R.V.I.S unless someone beats me to it! On the other handd I enjoy being lazy and doing nothing. I would say my spirit animal is a sloth becuase it fits my lazy tendicies which is about 85% of the time of my life. I come from Aurora Colorado and enjoy anything that involves sleeping. I also enjoy Volleyball a lot it is the one that keeps me from becoming a straight up bear. Other then that I feel I am a pretty basic person. </p> 
    <p> Someday I want to work for google which is why my favorite webiste is google, well that and ng and everything you want to know with a search bar and a keyboard. <a href="http://www.google.com"> <abbr title="favorite"> Fav </abbr> website </a></p>
